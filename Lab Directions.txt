We're using RESTful API for our quiz data created by json-server. Which we pulled up with the command >> npm run server
The file for this data is in package.json.


When the application loads, get all the questions from "http://localhost:4000/questions".
Display the questions in the "QuestionList" component.
Use useState and useEffect where needed. Think about which components need access to the question data.

When the user clicks "New Question", display a form for creating a new question. This form is already set-up as a controlled form.
So, all you have to do is send this form data to our API when its submitted.

Display the new question in "QuestionList" by updating state.

(because json-server has no validations, if you send the body of your request in the wrong format, it will have to be manually deleted from db.json)

When the user clicks "View Questions" a list of all questions from deliverable 1 should show up. (what is deliverable 1? maybe original set of questions)

When the "Delete" button is clicked, the question should be removed from the list (and server) by updating state. Include the ID of the question in the URL.
